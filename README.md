A fully functional, responsive website created for Shree Rameshwaram Dham, a spiritual sanctuary in Naimisharanya, UP, India. This project was developed entirely for free as an act of service (Seva) to help a deserving organization establish its digital presence.

The entire development process was a unique collaboration between a human project director (myself) and an AI engineering team powered by **Google's Gemini**.

## About The Project

During a visit to the holy site of Naimisharanyam, I was deeply moved by the heartfelt service offered by the staff at Shree Rameshwaram Dham Dharmshala. To express my gratitude and help their noble cause, I undertook this project to build them a website from scratch, allowing them to connect with devotees and supporters globally.

The core challenge was to build a professional, multi-page website without writing the code line-by-line myself. Instead, I leveraged advanced generative AI, guiding it through every step of the development lifecycle.

## Key Features

* **Fully Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
* **Multi-Page Architecture:** Includes separate, well-structured pages for Home, Services, Image Gallery, and Contact/Booking.
* **Interactive Image Gallery:** A clean, grid-based gallery featuring a Lightbox2 effect for enlarging images.
* **Detailed Donation Section:** Clearly presents the Dharmshala's mission and provides multiple ways for supporters to contribute.
* **Engaging 'Our Story' Section:** Features profiles of the Founder and Manager to add a personal touch.

## Tech Stack & Tools

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3
* **AI Development Partner:** Google's Gemini
* **External Libraries:** Lightbox2.js
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## A Unique Development Process: Human Direction, AI Execution

This project serves as a case study in modern **Prompt Engineering** and AI-driven development. My role was not that of a traditional coder but of a **Project Director** and **AI Skill Integrator**.

The workflow was as follows:

1.  **Initial Briefing:** I provided the initial vision, real-world context, and problem statement to the AI.
2.  **Iterative Prompting:** Through a series of detailed and specific prompts, I guided the AI to generate the complete HTML structure, CSS styles, and written content for the website.
3.  **Debugging & Refinement:** When issues like layout inconsistencies, unresponsive behavior, or bugs arose, I described the problems in natural language. The AI then analyzed the context and provided the necessary code fixes.
4.  **Feature Implementation:** New features like the lightbox gallery or profile cards were requested via targeted prompts, and the AI generated the required code blocks and integration steps.

This project demonstrates how a clear vision and effective prompt engineering can direct advanced AI tools to build complete, real-world applications efficiently and effectively.
